            <h2>Athletic Experiences</h2>
            <p>Sports have played an important role in my personal development, teaching me valuable lessons about teamwork, perseverance, and maintaining physical and mental health.</p>
            
            <h3>High School Basketball Team</h3>
            <p>I was part of my high school varsity basketball team in Seoul, where I learned the importance of collaboration and supporting teammates. Despite not being the strongest player, I contributed through consistent practice and positive attitude.</p>
            
            <h3>University Sports</h3>
            <p>At NYU, I look forward to participating in recreational sports leagues and regularly use the campus fitness facilities.</p>
