            <h2>Early Life and Origins</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea, where I spent my formative years surrounded by a rich cultural heritage and rapidly evolving technology landscape. Growing up in one of Asia's most dynamic cities shaped my perspective on innovation and tradition.</p>

            <h2>Educational Journey</h2>
            <p>I began my education in Seoul, South Korea at a local elementary school. Then, my family and I moved to Singapore, where I studied at an internationl school called Singapore American School. I came back to South Korea after 5 years, and spent the rest of middle and high school at Seoul Foreign School. I am currently studying at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu" target="_blank">New York University</a>, where I'm exploring various fields including buisness.</p>
            <p>The transition from my previous educational systems to university life has been both challenging and rewarding, offering me unique perspectives on different learning approaches.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Identity</h2>
            <p>Being Korean-American has given me the opportunity to bridge two cultures. I appreciate both the collective mindset and respect for elders from Korean culture, as well as the individualism and innovation encouraged in American society.</p>
