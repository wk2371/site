                    <h3>Stripped Humanity</h3>
                    <p>Another notable point is how the institution of the facility seems to have stripped away individuals' humanity. This is evident in numerous moments of the story, particularly Jon's constant reference to products and advertisements when articulating even his most personal emotions.</p>

                    <h3>The Advil Advertisement Example</h3>
                    <p>For instance, when he finds out that his memories of his mother were artificially created by the facility, he is understandably "freaked out" and upset. However, instead of actually describing his inner turmoil in a way that readers may relate to, he compares himself to man in an Advil advertisement LI 83743, whose house has flown away and hits his head on a floor.</p>
                    
                    <p>This incites a sense of uncanniness to Jon, as linking such a deeply personal moment to a commercial ad seems greatly strange. Hence, this shows how the facility, who constantly exposed Jon to advertisements, has robbed his humanity of expressing authentic emotions, but replacing them with consumerist values—advertisements.</p>

                        <p>Individuals are constantly shaped by institutions that surround them. This is especially true in the current world, where consumerism culture is growing rapidly, with materialistic things beginning to replace individuality and authenticity.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sanders, through the short, yet impactful story "Jon" satirizes the current world dictated by consumerism and materialism, and reminds readers the importance of maintaining individuality and humanity.</p>

                        <p>While "Jon" presents an extreme dystopian scenario, it reflects genuine concerns about contemporary consumer culture. As advertising becomes increasingly pervasive—through social media, streaming services, and daily life—the story's warning becomes more relevant: we must actively preserve our capacity for authentic emotion and individual expression against institutional forces that seek to shape us into consumers first, humans second.</p>

                    <div class="takeaway">
                        <h4>Institutional Power</h4>
                        <p>Institutions shape individuals not just through explicit control, but through gradual replacement of authentic values with institutional ones.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="takeaway">
                        <h4>Language & Identity</h4>
                        <p>The language we use to describe our experiences shapes how we understand ourselves. When that language becomes commercialized, so does our identity.</p>

                        <h4>Resistance & Awareness</h4>
                        <p>Saunders' story serves as a call to remain conscious of how consumer culture influences our self-perception and to actively preserve our humanity.</p>
