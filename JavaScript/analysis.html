                    <h3>Early Agency and Autonomous Action</h3>
                    <p>One way this text explores how people are formed and molded by an institution is through the development of Jon's character. Early in the story, Jon recalls his memory of him following the facility's instructional videos in their privacy tarps, engaging in a behavior sanctioned by the facility's coordinators.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, when Jon learns that Josh secretly broke the rules by entering another student's tarp, he too is motivated to cross the same boundary for Carolyn. Ultimately, Jon decides to sneak in, which results in Carolyn's pregnancy and their marriage. Clearly, Jon, in the beginning, is depicted as an individual with clear desires and actions that are driven by personal choice.</p>

                    <h3>The Transformation</h3>
                    <p>However, later in the story when Jon and Carolyn are discussing leaving the facility, Jon is reluctant, and seemingly even scared, to leave the comfort of the facility. As Carolyn points out, Jon entered her tarp as a "lion taking what he wanted", but now, became a "frightened bunny".</p>
                    
                    <p>This simile emphasizes the drastic change in Jon's character, showing how he, just like others, has grown dependent and complacent. While Jon's younger self operated on his own agency and desires, the facility has "created" a new version of Jon, who surrenders his authentic individuality to a false sense of comfort provided by consumerism, where he receives food and luxury goods from the facility.</p>

                        <p>This transformation symbolizes Jon's shift from an autonomous individual acting on desire to a dependent subject paralyzed by institutional conditioning.</p>
